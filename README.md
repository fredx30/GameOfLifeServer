# Game Of Life Server
This is an addendum to self-contained game of life game I created in my other game of life repo.
This will allow for rendering simulations centrally for cooperative viewing.

## Framework
This is based on the spring boot framework and will be written as a rest style api.

## DB
To be. The rest models will be supported by a neo4j database.

## Tests
There will be tests in the junit 5 style.
